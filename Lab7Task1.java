/****************************************************************************************************
 * Assignment: Lab 7 Task 1
 * Name: Gustavo Andia
 * Course: CS 151
 * Term: Spring 2024
 * 
 * Description:  This program allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in 
 * 				 a local election and the votes received by each candidate. The program then 
 * 				 outputs each candidateâ€™s name, the votes received by that candidate, and the 
 *               percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. The main method in 
 *               this program calls the arrayInputTaker() method to initialize the lastName[]
 *               and numbeOfVotes[] arrays. The program also calls the getTotalVotes() method
 *               to get the total votes for the election and finally calls the printResults()
 *               method to initialize the percentOfVotes[] array and print the results of 
 *               election to the screen.
